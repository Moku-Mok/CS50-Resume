I'm not really sure how to answer those questions well, but I guess the generally high-energy songs lend themselves to driving cars to, something like that?
A huge amount of the songs are rap, or in a similiarly wordy genre, so I wouldn't expect someone to fall into the zone with this, so not like "Dance-Music".

Overall I don't believe the Aura thing is very sensible though, because numbers won't accurately reflect the vibes of a song, which can vary wildly even in adjacent genres with similiar degrees of loudness and such.
