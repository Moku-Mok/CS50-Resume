                    <h3>Welcome to the MOVIES section!</h3>
                    <p>Growing up, my tastes were mostly informed by what was, well, on our local channels, and by what my mother would end up watching or showing me.
                        That's probably a pretty normal thing, I think, but my mother was very much into horror, and as a skittish kid, I often ended up sleeping in a room
                        with her, my own room was too big, dark and empty for me at some point, I think, and it scared me a bit.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ironically enough, what I mostly ended up watching with her were all kinds of different horror movies, things like Alien, Predator, many B-Movies I can't
                        name anymore, and things of that nature. Some really freaked me out, but watching them with her, and both of us being interested/invested in them felt special
                        to me, and I very quickly ended up loving them, instead of being genuinely afraid of them. It also helped that this was something only I did with my mom,
                        no sisters around or such!
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of my favourite movies from this, and they are still among some of my favs, would be Terminator, Alien, and Ghostbusters, though that last one
                        felt weirdly raunchy, with those Gargoyle creatures, I didn't like that part too much.
                     </p>

                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                     <p>Now when it comes to ANIME though...</p>
                     <p>As a child, the 'kids' channel we have here would always air a movie to end it's programming on the weekends, fridays and saturdays at 8:15 pm,
                        and very often, these ended up being Studio Ghibli movies, Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, Castle in the Sky and all the other ones.
                        Usually you would get a 'trailer' of sorts on wednesday or thursday for these, and seeing that a movie in 'that style' was coming up was always great,
                        I didn't even care if I'd already seen the particular movie, over the years they re-ran them quite a few times, they were just that awesome.
                        Even greater though, when you'd hear or see of a movie that you didn't even know existed before, when that happened I would essentially refuse to go on
                        family trips, because there was no chance in hell that I would allow myself to miss one of those 'really cool' movies. :)
                     </p>
                     <p>My favourite Ghibli movies are probably Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, and probably Nausica√§.</p>
