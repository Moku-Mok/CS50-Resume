                    <h3>Welcome to the MUSIC section!</h3>

                    <p>When it comes to the music I listen to, it really depends on the kind of mood I am. </br>
                    Sometimes I want to be introspective and think about things, other times I want a specific 'aesthetic' to be on my mind,
                    and calmer, atmospheric songs help me a lot with that kind of thing. </br>
                    If I want to sulk though, albums like Portamento, from The Drums, are great and calm too though.</p>

                    <p>Then, other times, there are times where I want to be energetic and possibly PISSED, that's when I'll be listening to
                        songs from Death Grips, Ex-Military and Bottomless Pit are probably my favourites by them, and they honestly just go
                        really hard. I can work out, or play video games with that kind of music playing, and sometimes slip into that weird state
                        of flow, where my concentration is amazing, and the abrasive music starts to feel like it IS my heart beating away, but in my head.
                        Something like that?
                    </p>

                    <p>Sometimes I just wanna relax though, and chill, that's when hip-hop and such are pretty great, some of it atleast.</p>

                    </br>

                    <p>Oh, I used to be incredibly deep into the whole Vaporwave and Futurefunk genre-scene, I even made some of my own under the name Derivle,
                        the last (and best one) I made was a remix of Garry Come Home from Spongebob Squarepants, and it kind of rocked.
