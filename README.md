Hi, my name is Dominik Paculla, and this is my CS50 repository.

Cloning this was a bit annoying to do, and I couldn't include the "movies" problem, as the database file was larger than the 25 mb limit that Github wants me to stick to.
Said problem was an SQL exercise though, with questions that ranged from "What's the SQL query to get all movies produced in 2002", to later much more complicated (but still relatively easy) queries.
